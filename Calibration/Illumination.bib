abstract = {The determination of the long-term memory colours of objects has been the subject of investigation for many years. Colour acceptance boundaries have been determined from the visual assessments of objects under variable illumination or by presenting manipulated images of objects on a calibrated computer display. However, a systematic and quantitative rating of the colour of real objects with respect to memory colour is not available at this moment. In this article, nine familiar real objects with colours distributed around the hue circle were positioned in a specially designed LED illumination box. For each object, approximately hundred real illumination spectra were synthesized in a random order keeping the luminance of the object approximately constant. Observers were asked to rate, on a five-point scale, the similarity of the perceived object colour to their idea of what the object looked like in reality. By avoiding specular reflections, the observer was unable to identify any clues as to the colour of the illumination. For each object, similarity ratings showed a good intraobserver and interobserver agreement. The ratings of all the observers were pooled and successfully modeled in IPT colour space by a bivariate Gaussian distribution. It was found that the chromaticity corresponding to the highest rating tended to be shifted toward higher chroma in comparison with the chromaticity calculated under D65 illumination. The bivariate distributions could be very useful in applications where the quantitative evaluation of the colour appearance of an object stimulus is required, such as in the evaluation of the colour rendering capabilities of a light source. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Can a single colour model be used for all colorimetric applications? This article intends to answer that question. Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@article{Smet2016,
abstract = {Recently, a group including the present authors developed a new color rendering (fidelity) measure, approved by the IES and henceforth referred to as IES Rf, that has two major updates with respect to the general color rendering index Ra of the CIE. First, it proposes an update to the more perceptually uniform CAM02-UCS color space. Secondly, instead of using only a small number (eight) of moderately saturated samples to determine a general color fidelity index, the IES method proposes using a set of 99 samples uniformly distributed in color space. In addition to the latter, the sample set has one other important property: spectral uniformity. This ensures that the sample set is not wavelength biased: all wavelengths contribute equivalently to the general color fidelity score. This article explores the importance of these two updates for color fidelity evaluation. It shows how the color space update results in a substantial spread of the new color fidelity scores relative to the old CIE Ra values and how the sample set update results in an overall reduction of color fidelity scores for most light source spectra with high CIE Ra (â‰¥80) and high luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) values, especially those with narrowband or spiked spectral features. It is shown that calculated color fidelity scores are affected by the degree of sample set spectral uniformity and that, in the absence of sample set spectral uniformity, light source spectra can be tuned to yield anomalously high CIE Ra values without necessarily yielding an increase in actual perceived color fidelity.},

@article{Smet2013,
abstract = {The CIE colour rendering index (CRI) has been criticized for its poor correlation with the visual colour rendering of many spiked or narrowband sources, its outdated colour space and chromatic adaptation transform and the use of a small number of non-optimal reflectance samples that have enabled lamp manufacturers to tune the spectrum of a light source to yield, in some cases, inappropriately high general CRI values. The CRI2012 metric proposed in this paper addresses these criticisms by combining the most state of the art colorimetric colour difference model, i.e. CAM02-UCS, with a mathematical reflectance set that exhibits a highly uniform spectral sensitivity. A set of 210 real reflectance samples has also been selected to provide additional information on the expected colour shifts when changing illumination.},

@article{David2015,
abstract = {We have developed a two-measure system for evaluating light sources' color rendition that builds upon conceptual progress of numerous researchers over the last two decades. The system quantifies the color fidelity and color gamut (change in object chroma) of a light source in comparison to a reference illuminant. The calculations are based on a newly developed set of reflectance data from real samples uniformly distributed in color space (thereby fairly representing all colors) and in wavelength space (thereby precluding artificial optimization of the color rendition scores by spectral engineering). The color fidelity score Rf is an improved version of the CIE color rendering index. The color gamut score Rg is an improved version of the Gamut Area Index. In combination, they provide two complementary assessments to guide the optimization of future light sources. This method summarizes the findings of the Color Metric Task Group of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES). It is adopted in the upcoming IES TM-30-2015, and is proposed for consideration with the International Commission on Illumination (CIE).},
