- 2 LED mixing mode

- Calibration thingy with blinking (warm / cold+red), (warm+cold / cold+red), (warm / cold+red / warm%)
  => Find out radiation power coefficients relative to warm LED

- Light output mixing based on perceived brightness
  - max 1000lm -> 10% = ~20lm, 33% = ~100lm, 50% = ~220lm, 80% = ~630lm regardless of color temperature
  => Generate general power control function
