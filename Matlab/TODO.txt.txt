- 3 LED mixing by optimizing preference
  - Rf,Rg angle?
  - Estimate CQS by Rf,Rg?
  - Simply multiply: Rf*Rg?
- Better fit coefficients display

- Calibration thingy with blinking (warm / cold+red), (warm+cold / cold+red), (warm / cold+red / warm%)
  => Find out radiation power coefficients relative to warm LED
- Max lumens plot

- Light output mixing based on perceived brightenss
  - max 1000lm -> 10% = 100lm regardless of color temperature
  => Generate general power control function
