- 3 LED mixing by optimizing Rf/Rg figure angle and Rg=110 (check CQS Qa estimated from Rf,Rg)
- Better Color icon background
- Rf by hue plot to inspectSpd
- Color distortion plot to inspectSpd
- Fit coefficients' displays to command window to work with any polynomial degree
- Calibration thingy with blinking (warm / cold+red), (warm+cold / cold+red), (warm / cold+red / warm%)
  => Find out radiation power coefficients relative to warm LED
- Max lumens plot
- Light output mixing based on luminous efficacy
  - max 1000lm -> 10% = 100lm regardless of color temperature
  => Generate general power control function
